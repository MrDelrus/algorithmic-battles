# Algorithmic Battles

**Competitive tournaments for algorithmic strategies and lightweight AI logic in WebAssembly across multiple games.**

This repository hosts tournaments where participants submit strategies. Each strategy is evaluated in a sandboxed environment, and results are compiled into a leaderboard. The repository is designed to support multiple games with potentially different rules and APIs.
